This package implements the macro `##`, which provides compact
syntax for short `lambda`, without actually being new syntax,
which would be difficult to get merged into Emacs.  Past attempts
to add syntax were met with determined pushback and the use of a
macro was suggested as an alternative.

The `##` macro, whose signature is `(## FN &rest args)`, expands
to a `lambda` expressions, which wraps around its arguments.

This `lambda` expression calls the function FN with arguments
ARGS and returns its value.  Its own arguments are derived from
symbols found in ARGS.  Each symbol from `%1` through `%9`, which
appears in ARGS, is treated as a positional argument.  Missing
arguments are named `_%N`, which keeps the byte-compiler quiet.
In place of `%1` the shorthand `%` can be used, but only one of
these two can appear in ARGS.  `%*` represents extra `&rest`
arguments.

Instead of:

```elisp
(lambda (a _ c &rest d)
  (foo a (bar c) d))
```

you can use this macro and write:

```elisp
(##foo % (bar %3) %*)
```

which expands to:

```elisp
(lambda (% _%2 %3 &rest %*)
  (foo % (bar %3) %*))
```

The name `##` was choosen because that allows (optionally)
omitting the whitespace between it and the following symbol.
It also looks similar to `#'function`.
